# TIC TAC TOE Game

## Project Objective:
The main goal of this project was to deepen and develop a better understanding of mechanics around factory functions. The objective was to gain insight into how they work and enhance Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) knowledge within the context of a simple web game environment.

## Project Explanation:
In the architecture of the project, each element of the game is created using factory functions. The aim was to avoid writing code outside these functions and to blueprint the entire project in a way that every aspect of the game would be represented by an object.

The game board is dynamically rendered in JavaScript using a factory function, and each field on the game board is an object, allowing easy manipulation of the field's state and checking whether it is free or occupied. Consequently, each player has specific actions and properties to store and track data during the game. Understanding the asynchronous nature of JavaScript was crucial for certain parts of the code, as some sections can only run after each player takes action.

## Summary:
In conclusion, despite being a well-known and simple game, this project helped me write cleaner code and significantly enhanced my OOP skills in JavaScript, thanks to the concepts I learned and applied.
